Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

✅Summary:-

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical attributes using supervised learning techniques.✅

👉Overview:-

Diabetes is a chronic disease that requires early detection to reduce severe health risks.✅
This project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze patient medical data and predict diabetes outcomes.✅ It demonstrates the complete ML pipeline including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using real-world healthcare data.✅

❓Problem Statement :-

Early detection of diabetes is critical but often limited by manual analysis and delayed diagnosis.✅
The challenge is to build an accurate and reliable machine learning model that can classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on diagnostic health parameters.
